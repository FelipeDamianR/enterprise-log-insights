## Key Findings

1. **Critical Errors Concentrated in Few Users**  
   - Only 5 users generated over 22,000 critical errors.  
   - A single user was responsible for more than 16,000 repeated failures.  

2. **Errors by Country**  
   - ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico â†’ business logic failures.  
   - ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom â†’ interoperability and data structure errors.  
   - ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States â†’ interface and UX issues.  
   - While Mexico had more total errors, the U.S. showed the **highest proportion of severe errors**.  

3. **Error Diversity per User**  
   - Some users generated up to **68 different types of errors**.  
   - Suggests misconfigurations, improper use, or environment-specific issues.  

4. **Possible Anomalies / Automation**  
   - One user accumulated **over 1 million records**, with repetitive operations at night.  
   - Strong indication of automated or unsupervised scripts.  

5. **Rarely Used Methods**  
   - Certain methods were executed thousands of times but by very few users.  
   - Requires **security review** to rule out misuse or unauthorized testing.
